# OSHA's Budget And Inflation Graph
This repository contains the code used to create a graph showing how OSHA's budget has eroded due to inflation. My hope is that the graph may enrich the public discussion around OSHA's budget, showing quantitatively what many know intuitively. The data, however, is somewhat tricky, and the notes mentioned in the graph are expanded upon here.

## OSHA Budget
Except for fiscal year (FY) 2024, the OSHA budget data comes from Sage Data (https://data.sagepub.com/dataset/datasheet?id=18E3517173A22&type=Datasheet).

The problem with its numbers past FY 2023 is that they are misleading. SAGE uses the number _requested_ by the Department of Labor in its "Fiscal Year 2024 - Budget in Brief" (https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/budget/2024/FY2024BIB.pdf, page 42).

But this was just a request--the actual operating budget was the same as FY 2023 (https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/budget/2024/FY2024OperatingPlanAPT.pdf, page 5).
